# Advent Of Code 2017
These are my solutions to the problems at http://adventofcode.com for the 2017 adventure. I tend to try to solve the problems in both a high-level language (Python) and a low-level language (C/C++).

Navigate to each folder to see the solution(s) for the problem of that day.

I really recommend this website for programming practice.
